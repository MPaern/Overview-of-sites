    "text": "Noise\nFigure 2 Shows the proportion of noise in all the sites. We can see that some of the sites are a lot noisier than others. Coastal sites tend to have more noise, but it varies from 20% (CM-27, sheltered by Kvassheim lighthouse) to 99% (Utsira-2). From lakesites, the most noise was 78% (CM-14, lake in Lista) and the least 11% (CM-34, guitarmuseum).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2: Proportion of noise on sites\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nComparison of noise in different sites\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3\n\n\n\nIf we look at the total amount of 5 second recordings on Figure 4, then the amount of noise varies less, with CM-12 (coast near Lista) being an extra noisy location. The best overview of how locations differ gives Figure 5. We can see that the number of recordings we can work with is times bigger in lake sites than in coastal sites.\nIn terms of how to distribute sites to different classes, I have made a third, “inland” class that doesn’t really fit under the two others, with CM-01 (Utsira lighthouse), CM-07 (Raulemyra) and CM-41 (NMBU campus). Coastal sites are sites up to 400m from the coast, the furthest away being CM-25 near Brusand with 380 meters. There is also one lake site that falls into the 400m cutoff, CM-34 (Guitarmuseum) that is 280m from the coast. As for the inland sites, CM-01 is 600m from the coast and 480m from a freshwater lake, CM-07 is 9000m from the coast and 230m from a bigger freshwater source (wider part of a stream), CM-41 is 2230m from the coast and 100m from a bigger freshwater source (wider part of a stream).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4: Amount of recordings and noise\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 5: Correlation between recordings and the amount of noise"

When we compare the coast and the lakes, we can see that the amount of calls differs a lot (Figure 7).\nOut of the top 4 coastal locations, top 2 are next to big rivers (Obrestad Prestegård, Brusand), third one is a fjord that looks like a lake (Framvaren) and fourth one is very sheltered from the sea (Stapnes bedehus).\nCM-46 is the only lake site in a wind farm, but the low number of detections may be due to other reasons.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 6: Amount of bat calls\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(a) AutoID on coast\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(b) AutoID around lakes\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(c) AutoID inland\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 7: Comparison of autoid in different sites"
